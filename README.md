Josef's Creative Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my creative passionsâ€”digital art, short stories, coding projects, and more. I built it from scratch with the help of Grok, as part of my journey into web development. Whether youâ€™re here to see my artwork, read my modern spins on Aesopâ€™s fables, or check out my coding experiments, I hope you enjoy exploring my world!
