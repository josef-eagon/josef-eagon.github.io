          <div class="content">
            <p>A boy returned home to his mother with a stolen lesson plan from his teacher. The mother was amused by the act and laughed in glee.
              
              As the boy grew older, he continued with his thieving and with each new crime increased the value of the object stolen.</p>
              
            <p>Eventually, the Thief was caught and brought before justice with his mother weeping behind him. The Thief turned to her in the courtroom and asked her to lean in for embrace upon receiving his guilty sentence.
              
              Whereupon the Thief bit the tip of his mother’s nose off, shouting, “If only you had chastised me in my youth, I would not be in this predicament!”</p>
            <p>— — — — — 
            <p>oho! I suppose this is what it means to bite the nose to spite the face. 
              
              Peculiar lessons in this fable…
              
              I suspect the boy needed more lessons at home than simply not to steal. Perhaps that’s why he brought one home to begin with.</p>
