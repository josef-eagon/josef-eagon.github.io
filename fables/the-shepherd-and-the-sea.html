          <h2 class="title is-2">The Shepherd and the Sea</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>There was a Shepherd who lived in the outskirts of a small village near the Sea. The Shepherd would take his flock out to the fields along the coast, 
              and watch as the waves polished the shore.

              He dreamed lofty dreams of one day leaving his station, "I will sell my belongings and travel to lands far from here, 
              selling merchandise to people for their every want and need."</p>
              
            <p>After some time, the Shepherd's flock had grown mature and healthy, whereupon the Shepherd decided to wait no longer. 
              He sold his flock and land to purchase a ship heavy with dates to sell at some merchant city buried beneath the horizon of the sea. 
              
              During voyage, a furious wind stirred the ocean waters, and quickly gave way to a powerful tempest. The ship, heavy with the dates, 
              thrashed and toppled into the sea. 
              
            <p>Forced to return on a beaten ship, missing most of the cargo, he began his life again as a shepherd. 
              
              Years later, once the Shepherd had acquired some notable coin and a healthy flock, he returned to the spot along the coast. 
              The sea gently patted the sandy shores, again inviting the Shepherd to take journey. 
              
              "You would have me try to become a merchant again?" cried the Shepherd to the Sea. "Or are you simply hungry for more dates?"</p>
              
            <p>-- -- -- -- -- </p>
            <p>oho! i think the shepherd should try again, but only if he is unhappy. 
              
              Why not just have a professional ship captain take him? Why dates? A lot to think about.</p>
